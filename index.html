            <h6>First, sign up! We'll ask you a few questions about yourself
                and your preferences in meeting people. Each week, we'll send you a 
                match; either you or the other person will be "assigned" to send a greeting
                message to take away the worry about whether to reach out first. We'll include 
                a couple conversation starters, and you can start chatting away!
