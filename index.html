                to be successful (this is completely made up, idk what stat/quote we wanna go with). 
                Also I wonder how to make this not bold? Meeting people through social media can be
                awkward and nerve-racking; we're here to make the first move so you don't have to.
                natch will connect you with other students at your school to help you make friendships, natch!

                and your preferences in meeting people. Each week, we'll send you a 
                match; either you or the other person will be "assigned" to send a greeting
                message to take away the worry about whether to reach out first. We'll include 
                a couple conversation starters, and you can start chatting away!
